name:                casadi-bindings
version:             1.9.0.1
synopsis:            low level bindings to CasADi
category:            Numerical, Math
description:
    Haskell bindings to the CasADi algorithmic differentiation and optimal control library.
    Version numbers correspond to the C++ library version numbers except the very last number
    which may indicate breaking changes.
    .
    This is a metapackage which also hosts the installation instructions. The purpose is that
    users of the library will always be able to "cabal install casadi-bindings" and have things
    Just Work, though you may need to install additional add-on modules manually.
    .
    The `casadi-bindings-internal` package is handwritten and provides some casadi memory management
    wrappers and C++ standard type marsahalling.
    .
    The rest of the modules like `casadi-bindings-core`, `casadi-bindings-ipopt-interface`, etc
    are autogenerated from casadi's swig interface and correspond exactly to the casadi C++ API.
    .
    For high-level bindings, see my `https://github.com/ghorn/dynobud` project
    .
    The current instructions for getting started on Debian/Ubuntu:
    .
    Install libcasadi-shared from https://github.com/casadi/casadi/releases/latest,
    first download it from that website, then:
    .
    >> dpkg -i libcasadi-shared.deb
    .
    >> cabal update; cabal install casadi-bindings
    .
    to install the ipopt interface:
    .
    >> apt-get install coinor-libipopt-dev
    .
    >> cabal install casadi-bindings-ipopt-interface
    .
    Temporary note: there is something wrong with casadi and ipopt related
    to http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2014-April/003670.html,
    and https://github.com/casadi/casadi/issues/1075.
    At the moment this .cabal package works for me as is, but YMMV
    .
    I only officially support debian/ubuntu right now, but I have gotten it working on OSX
    in the past. Everything is done with pkg-config and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so there's no reason
    I know that there should be problems.
