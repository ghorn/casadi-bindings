===============

haskell bindings to the CasADi algorithmic differentiation and optimal control library


A hackage release is immenent. If you're impatient, here are the Debian/Ubuntu instructions:

-Install casadi from a .deb package here: https://github.com/casadi/casadi/releases, I use libcasadi-static.
-clone this repo and `cd wrappers`
-`make gen`
-`cabal install`
