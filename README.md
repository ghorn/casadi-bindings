[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/casadi-bindings.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/casadi-bindings)

haskell bindings to the CasADi algorithmic differentiation and optimal control library

This project is mainly a bindings generation tool, which I use to generate
cabal packages for release on hackage. You should really try to use the hackage
releases instead of this repository by following the instructions at:
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/casadi-bindings

.

I generate bindings by running WriteBindings/WritePackage.hs. Some of the paths
are hard-coded for my setup.
